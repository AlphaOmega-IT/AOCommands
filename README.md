# AOCommands - Alternate Essentials

AOCommands is a alternate system to all the plugins outside. You gain access to multilanguage files, several commands for version 1.19.X. Additionally it has a custom CommandHandler and InventoryManager. Also you can obtain Anvil rename texts without packets when trying to rename a armorstand!  

It will also gonna have a own Armorstand Tool GUI with several functions! 

I will also add soon, the posibility to switch between database and filesavings. So I can also add a own economy system, and maybe some future things! 
If you have any ideas feel free to message me! 

Hibernate framework implementation is still work in progress, also the usage of the CompletableFutures. 

A possible beta of the system can you find entering the ip Atramis.de in your mc laucher. I might implement as well my unique oneblock system with a unique style of gameplay! Make sure to stay hyped until it gonna cost few bucks! :D
